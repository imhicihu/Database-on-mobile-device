# Rationale #

* This repository shows an inner project, _in-house_ solution to track the bibliographical assets of the `Reinhardt collection`. 
* Just a Macbook Air (for testing and programming) and Ipad Air (to collect the data) on the hardware side. 
* The software that tied both hardware was FileMaker.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
     - A solution-driven app to collect data (a basement where even a notebook can't operate successfully). 
     - We create this portable application to fix this bottleneck.
