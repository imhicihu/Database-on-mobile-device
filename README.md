# Rationale #

* This repository shows an inner project, _in-house_ solution to track the bibliographical assets of the `Reinhardt collection`. 
* Just a Macbook Air (for testing and programming) and Ipad Air (to collect the data) on the hardware side. 
* The software that tied both hardware was FileMaker.
